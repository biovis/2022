### Once upon a time in Bio-Medical Data Visualization: Reflections on Research Before and During Pandemic

[Tatiana von Landesberger](https://visva.cs.uni-koeln.de/landesberger),
University of Cologne

**Abstract:** Research in visualization is often motivated by the endeavor to
improve on the illustration of data: in order to better communicate data to
others and to gain deeper insights into complex datasets, possibly from a
variety of data sources. In the medical domain, the data can include for
example patient data, health records as well as biologic data such as genome.
Insights to be obtained from data may relate inter alia to the spreading of
diseases, evolutionary analysis and virus mutations. The tasks include both
retrospective analysis for finding the patient zero and modelling the spreading
of a disease, as well predictive modelling of virus mutations and future disease
spreading. The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted this general motivation for our
research to a need for practical solutions. Infection control experts needed to
quickly gain insights into novel datasets and to communicate the insights to
colleagues and to a broader public, requiring quick and efficient visualization
solutions.

New methods, tools, and methodologies have popped up from basic and from applied
research. New data was collected, model results were produced that required
rapid analysis. Multi-disciplinary teams worked and applied solutions to the new
challenges resulting from the pandemic. The rapid response was only possible by
leveraging on the experience and past research. Thus, the talk will take a
larger historical perspective and present specific solutions from own
experience, including reflections on data, task and user triangle as well as the
challenges of multidisciplinary working styles.

**Bio:** Tatiana von Landesberger is a full professor of Computer Science â€“
Visualization at University of Cologne, Germany. She received a PhD in 2010 and
finished her habilitation in 2017 at TU Darmstadt, Germany. Her research focuses
on information visualization and visual analytics of spatio-temporal and network
data from various domains such as biology, medicine, finance, transportation,
journalism or meteorology. Her recent research addresses the challenges of
perception and cognition of visualization as well as visual analysis of disease
spreading. She regularly publishes at top international conferences and has
received multiple awards. Tatiana has served in program committees and
organization committees for IEEE VIS, EuroVis, VMV and other venues. Recently,
she was full paper chair at EuroVis and is now member of EuroVis steering
committee and associate editor of Computer Graphics Forum.
