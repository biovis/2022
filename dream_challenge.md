### Background

The [ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling RNA DREAM Challenge (SMC-RNA)](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2813589/wiki/) rests on the increasing emphasis and importance of RNA biology. The SMC-RNA Challenge focusses on a specific kind of aberrant genes namely fusion genes. Putative genomic rearrangements in cancer cells produce fusion transcripts further translating into fusion proteins containing chimeric domains from two genes. Gene fusions have an important role in the initial steps of tumorigenesis. Specifically, gene fusions have been found to be the driver mutations in neoplasia and have been linked to various tumor subtypes. Fusion genes are often manifest as isoforms. Conceptually, isoforms are alternative expressions of a gene formed from splicing and RNA-editing or aberrant splicing that could occur during post-transcriptional processing.

[Our SMC-RNA BioVis Data Visualization DREAM Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6828822/wiki/402099) investigates the role of visualization in supporting the identification and characterization of gene fusions and isoforms and is calling for entries that will enhance the understanding of biology. At a broad level, we would like to answer questions such as *“How can one  identify and visualize the population of isoforms present in a single sample and the relative abundance of each?”* or *“How can one  compare across a cohort to identify  regions with common isoforms or mutually exclusive isoforms in cancer”.*

### Timeline

The challenge is anticipated to launch in early 2018 and is expected to run through the fall of 2018.
