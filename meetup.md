## Welcome to the BioVis meetup

The **BioVis meetup** is a new virtual seminar series organised by the BioVis
community to complement the BioVis sessions at ISMB (July) and IEEE Vis
(October). Why? We wanted to hang out more regularly with the BioVis community.

We hope this space will grow over time and evolve with input from the worldwide
community of all people "BioVis": wet-lab researchers, clinicians,
bioinformaticians, visualization researchers, designers, data scientists, all
invested in biomedical data visualization.

### Invitation to BioVis meetup #1

For the January'22 BioVis meetup we'll have a presentation and chat with
**Matthias Stahl** from DER SPIEGEL. Matthias is a PhD scientist,
founder of design studio higsch, and now co-lead of Graphics & Interactive
department at a leading German weekly. Matthias will describe his route from
bacteria and childhood cancer to political news and how this is all connected
by his passion for data and visualizations.

Join us on *Tuesday, 25th of January* at 5pm Berlin / 4 pm
London / 11am East Coast US / 8 am California / (recording available):
**"From bench to news site: Changing the world with data visualization"**
