## Welcome to the BioVis meetup

The **BioVis meetup** is a new virtual seminar series organised by the BioVis
community to complement the BioVis sessions at ISMB (July) and IEEE Vis
(October). Why? We wanted to hang out more regularly with the BioVis community.

We hope this space will grow over time and evolve with input from the worldwide
community of all people "BioVis": wet-lab researchers, clinicians,
bioinformaticians, visualization researchers, designers, data scientists, all
invested in biomedical data visualization.
