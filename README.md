# BioVis 2021 Websites

The 2021 version of the BioVis website.

It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as CMS and it is a copy of the 2020 version of the website.

This is compiled by Caleydo Jenkins and pushed to the [Biovis 2021 main website repo](https://github.com/biovis/2021).

This is automatically built and moved to the folder of the repository at [https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/](https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/)

# To create a next year fork you need to do the following:

1) create a new repository (e.g., 2022) at [https://github.com/biovis/](https://github.com/biovis/)

2) update the _config.yml file

3) update the remaining content of the webpage as you see fit

4) push the changes into the new repository (created in step 1)

5) update forwarding in the index.html file at [https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/](https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/)
