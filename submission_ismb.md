## Submission Types and Criteria
There are several possibilities to contribute to the program of BioVis @ ISMB:

## 1. ISMB Proceedings - Submission Deadline: January 28, 2019

Novel, unpublished work can be submitted as a paper to the ISMB Proceedings. If accepted, manuscripts will be published in the OUP Journal Bioinformatics. Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their work at the symposium in a talk. Authors of rejected papers will be invited to submit a poster.

### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a full paper by January 28, 2019  through the [ISMB Proceedings Submission Site](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019-submit/proceedings) and must adhere to the submission guidelines outlined on that site. 

#### **IMPORTANT: During submission please select the general subject of your submissions, and then make sure to <strong>specify BioVis as the "TOPIC" of your submission</strong> to ensure your manuscript is assigned to our COSI.**

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance paper submissions, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. However, please note that OUP does not support videos as supplementary materials, so you will have to host the video elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).

## 2. Abstracts - Submission Deadline: April 11, 2019; Poster Submission Deadline: {{ site.ismb_poster_submission_deadline }}
We are now accepting long abstracts (1500 words) for talks describing new work, and short abstracts (200 words) highlighting work recently published. We also invite abstracts for posters describing work in progress and preliminary results and these will also be considered for oral presentation during the meeting.

### Submission Guidelines
Submissions are made via the [2019 ISMB/ECCB Abstracts Submission](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbeccb2019abstract) system by selecting the ‘BioVis COSI’ as the track relevant to your submission.
