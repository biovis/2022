We are pleased to announce **BioVis Meetup #6**!

### When

Join us **Jan 31** at 5 pm Berlin / 4 pm London / 11am East Coast US
/ 8 am California /

**Communicating Scientific Concepts Through Art**
with Beata Edyta Mierzwa, PhD - Molecular Biologist and Science Artist, Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research and UC San Diego and "Beata Science Art"

**Abstract:**
Creativity is an integral part of both science and art, and using it to combine
these two seemingly different disciplines creates unique and effective ways to
communicate scientific information, both inside and outside the scientific
community. Along my classical academic career path, I have been exploring the
visual aspect of science communication using hand-drawn illustrations, science
fashion, and interactive media. My drawings aim to convey complex biological
concepts using both abstract imagery and real scientific data. Each illustration
requires breaking down the essence of scientific findings and translating them
into aesthetic visuals using metaphors that describe complex biological
processes in intuitive ways. This form of visualization provides a powerful tool
to facilitate communication between researchers from diverse fields, spark
fascination and curiosity for science, as well as inspire our next generation of
scientists. In this talk, I will share my journey towards combining science and
art, highlight the impact of artistic practices on my own research and
communication, and discuss avenues for scientists to explore this emerging
field.
