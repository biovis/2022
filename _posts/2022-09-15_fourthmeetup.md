**Human-machine collaboration in surgery - how visualization can benefit the patient.** 

with: **Stefanie Speidel** - Prof. Translational Surgery, NCT-UCC at the University Hospital Dresden/Germany 

Attention: meetup takes place 30 min earlier than usual! 

Abstract:
Increasingly powerful technological developments in surgery such as modern operating rooms (OR), featuring digital and interconnected as well as robotic devices provide a huge amount of valuable data which can be used to improve patient therapy. Although a lot of data is available, the human ability to use these possibilities especially in a complex and time-critical situation such as surgery is limited and is extremely dependent on the experience of the surgical staff.
 
In this talk, Stefanie Spidel presents her recent research regarding AI-assisted surgery with a specific focus on visualization for intraoperative assistance. Several examples to optimize the therapy of the individual patient by turning the available data into useful information are given, including context-aware assistance via augmented reality. Finally, remaining challenges and strategies to overcome them are discussed.
