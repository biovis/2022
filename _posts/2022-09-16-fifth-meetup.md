**Visualising science: communicating complex research with information graphics at Nature**
with:  
Nik Spencer – Art editor, Nature  
Jasiek Krzysztofiak – Art Editor, Nature

Abstract:
The presentation will discuss how the main concepts of research papers are identified to produce concise, informative graphics aimed at non-specialist readers for Nature News & Views articles. Drafts submitted by authors will be considered and assessed, followed by a summary of the process involved in adapting and developing the ideas into figures for publication. There will be an overview of the core principles of Nature graphic style, how this is applied to determine figure content and design, and how this style is used to highlight key points in the research.
