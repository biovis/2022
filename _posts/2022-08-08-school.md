We are happy to announce the second Summer School on Biological and Medical Visualization: the [Bio+Med+Vis School](https://biomedvis.github.io/2022/)! 

The Summer School will be held on September 19–21, 2022 in Brno, Czech Republic as a hybrid event. The event precedes the EG VCBM conference, which will be held on September 22–23 in nearby Vienna, Austria, just a short train ride from Brno. Participants can anticipate three days of excellent talks, given by experts in Biological and Medical Visualization.

The registration for the Bio+Med+Vis School will be free of charge and it will provide access to an educational platform, where all materials will be available afterward. To join us, just fill in the registration form before August 15, 2022.
